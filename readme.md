ContextObjects.org is a non-profit organization dedicated to educating and empowering individuals to create Context Objects for various entities, such as individuals, companies, organizations, families, and communities. By providing users with the tools to create and control their own Context Objects, we aim to promote transparency, user agency, and privacy in personalized AI interactions.

## What are Context Objects?

Context Objects are structured representations of information, preferences, and experiences for different entities. They serve as a long-term memory or exocortex store that can be easily referenced by AI language models (LLMs) to provide more accurate and tailored responses. Context Objects can be created for various entities, including:

- Individuals: Personal information, preferences, life experiences, and goals
- Companies: Business details, mission, products, services, and team members
- Organizations: Purpose, structure, members, activities, and objectives
- Families: Family members, relationships, traditions, and shared experiences
- Communities: Location, demographics, culture, events, and collective goals

## Public vs. Private Context Objects

One of the core principles of ContextObjects.org is the distinction between public and private Context Objects. This allows users to maintain control over their data and decide what information they want to share openly and what they prefer to keep private.

- **Public Context Objects:** These are Context Objects that are openly accessible and can be referenced by anyone. They contain information that the user is comfortable sharing with the public, such as general preferences, interests, or professional background. Public Context Objects can be easily discovered and utilized by various applications and services to provide personalized experiences.

- **Private Context Objects:** These are Context Objects that contain sensitive or personal information that the user wants to keep confidential. Private Context Objects are protected by a specific token or key, which is required to access the data. Users can selectively share their private Context Objects with trusted applications or services, ensuring that their sensitive information remains secure.

By offering both public and private Context Objects, ContextObjects.org empowers users to have granular control over their data and privacy while still benefiting from personalized AI interactions.

## Why Use Context Objects?

By creating and sharing Context Objects, you enable LLMs to instantly access relevant information about the entity, allowing for more personalized and efficient interactions. This eliminates the need to repeatedly provide background information and ensures that the AI can better understand and assist based on the unique context of the entity. With the ability to create both public and private Context Objects, users can tailor their data sharing according to their comfort level and privacy requirements.

## Building on Proprietary Concepts

ContextObjects.org builds on the proprietary concepts used by Meta's internal OpenGraph psychographic profiles and OpenAI's long-term memory, but with a crucial difference. While these companies keep their implementations within walled gardens, ContextObjects.org is specifically designed to be open-source and collaborative, with a strong emphasis on user control and privacy through the use of public and private Context Objects.

By making context objects accessible and interoperable across different platforms and services while respecting user privacy, we aim to democratize the power of personalized AI interactions and give users greater control over their data. Our open-source approach ensures transparency and allows for community-driven innovation, fostering a more inclusive and empowering ecosystem for everyone.

We believe that the future of AI should be built on open standards and collaboration, rather than being siloed within proprietary systems. ContextObjects.org is our contribution to this vision, and we invite you to join us in shaping a more open and equitable landscape for AI-driven personalization.

## Features

- User-friendly tool for creating public and private Context Objects for various entities
- Flexible format that allows users to express context in a natural way
- Open-access alternative to proprietary solutions like Meta's psychographic profiles and OpenAI's long-term memory
- Promotes transparency, user control, and privacy in personalized AI interactions

## Getting Started

To create your own public and private Context Objects and start enjoying more personalized AI interactions, follow these steps:

1. Visit our website at [contextobjects.org](https://contextobjects.org)
2. Navigate to the Context Object creation tool at [contextobjects.org/create](https://contextobjects.org/create)
3. Select the type of entity you want to create a Context Object for (e.g., individual, company, organization, family, or community)
4. Fill in the required information about the entity, its preferences, experiences, and relevant details
5. Specify whether the Context Object should be public or private
6. Generate the Context Object and obtain the reference pointer (and access token/key for private Context Objects)
7. Include the reference pointer (and access token/key if applicable) in your future LLM prompts to enable personalized interactions

## Future Concepts and Contributions

We have several ideas for future enhancements to the ContextObjects.org project, and we welcome contributions from the community to help bring these concepts to life:

### Centralized Context Object Management

We envision a centralized server that manages your context objects for you. This server would provide a secure and reliable way to store, update, and retrieve your context objects, making it easier to share them across different applications and services.

### Handling Public and Private Context Objects via a Centralized API

We are seeking proposals and contributions on how to effectively handle public and private Context Objects through a centralized Context Object API. Some potential ideas include:

- Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access private Context Objects
- Providing granular access controls and permissions for sharing private Context Objects with specific applications or services
- Developing a robust API architecture that can efficiently handle the storage, retrieval, and updating of both public and private Context Objects
- Implementing encryption and data protection measures to safeguard sensitive information in private Context Objects

We welcome any ideas, suggestions, or implementations that can help us create a secure and user-friendly centralized API for managing public and private Context Objects.

### Crawlable Indexable File Format

Alternatively, you could include your context object as a crawlable indexable file on your own website using a particular format, similar to the robots.txt file in the root of the website. This would allow applications and services to easily discover and retrieve your context object without relying on a centralized server.

### Context Object Sync Tool

To facilitate the integration of context objects stored on a central server with individual websites, we propose the development of a tool that imports your context object from the central server and loads the latest version on your server at runtime. This tool would ensure that your website always has access to the most up-to-date version of your context object.

### Real-time Context Object Updates

In addition to the sync tool, we also envision a mechanism for sending updates back to the central server to update your context object during sessions. This could be achieved using a special token or key, allowing for real-time synchronization of your context object across different platforms and services.

If you're interested in contributing to any of these features or have other ideas for improving the ContextObjects.org project, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on our GitHub repository. We appreciate your support and collaboration in making context objects more accessible and useful for everyone.

## Managing Your Own Context Objects

In the future ContextObjects.com will offer a centralized managed context object service, we believe that users should have the freedom to manage their own context objects if they prefer. If you choose to manage your context objects independently, you can simply copy and paste your context object at runtime when interacting with AI language models.

The centralized managed context object provider is designed for users who prefer the convenience of storing their context objects in the cloud and making them easily accessible across different platforms and services. However, it is not a requirement, and users are free to manage their context objects in the way that best suits their needs.

## Request for Funding

ContextObjects.org is in the process of setting up contextobjects.com, a managed context object service run by our non-profit organization. To support the development and maintenance of this service, we are seeking funding from individuals and organizations who share our vision of empowering users with control over their data and enabling personalized AI interactions.

If you are interested in contributing to the development of the managed context object service, please visit our funding page at [contextobjects.org/donate](https://contextobjects.org/donate). Your support will help us create a robust and user-friendly platform that makes it easy for people to store, manage, and share their context objects securely.

We appreciate any contributions, whether they are financial donations, technical expertise, or help with spreading the word about our project. Together, we can build a more open and equitable future for personalized AI interactions.
